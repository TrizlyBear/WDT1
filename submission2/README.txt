The submission folders might look messy, but that's the result of the way the assignment wants us to submit it.
Some files might be in multiple folders, since regex and builtin are both in all the form files.

builtin_form - includes all html pages that have builtin form features
regular_expression - includes all html pages that have regular expressions (the same files as builtin forms)
custom_JS - includes all html pages that have embedded JS and external JS files
